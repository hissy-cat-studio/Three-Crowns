# Lore

The Great Walled City-State of Kaztani, nestled at the southern tip of the Yodezil continent is home to millions of citizens is ruled by King Ozla "The Old Lion".

King Ozla, who is now in his later years, desperately desires an heir to his throne, has recently married his third Queen Wife, Anahita. King Ozla's first two Queen Wives died during labor along with unborn male heirs. It has been said, the sheer virility of the Old Lion is a curse and that no woman in all of Kaztani could bear the Old Lion's heir.

Within months of the wedding, the news of the Queen Wife’s pregnancy has spread through the vast city-state of Kaztani. As the birth ceremony grew closer, many worried for the Queen Wife. Would she survive and bear a male heir, or would she suffer the same fate as the two previous Queen Wives, and black smoke drift out of the small pipe chimney of the royal birthing chambers as it has on two occasions.

Crimson smoke. The crowds that are crammed into the citizens square are in shock. 

Amaya, the Queen Daughter is born. 

Option through the Kingdom is mixed. Many believed the Curse of the Old Lion had once again had a hand in the birth of a Queen Daughter and she has signaled the loss of strength of the Old Lion, and the end of the Qzla legacy and the great City-Stae of Kaztani. It was simply a matter of time before the long line of Ozla rule ended and the Great City-State would collapse from both forces inside the walls and abroad. 

Over the next two arduous two years, and an endless procession of Mystics, Clergy, and Oracles to bless and enchant the Queen Wife to bear a male heir, news of a second pregnancy was announced. 

The Great City-State of Kazani was on edge. Would the Curse of the Old Lion strike again and bring riots and death to the streets of the Great Walled City-State? 

The faithful day finally arrives late. The city-state is ready to explode, the military is on full alert and a three-day house bound curfew that has been in full effect is starting to take its toll on the citizens. 

Finally King Ozla, steps out on the royal balcony that overlooks the citizen square, Azure smoke drifts above him, and in his arms The Old Lion holds three swaddled male heirs. 

Slowly the Azure smoke is mixed with and replaced by Black smoke. 
Anahita, the Queen Wife has not survived the birth of her three sons.

King Ozla, retreats into the Royal chambers, clearly exhausted and distraught. 

For three weeks there is little news from the Old Lion or his court. Rumors abound as well as both fear and hope. Trying times in the history of the Great City-State.

# Day 1, The Three Crowns.

It was a normal day in the Great Walled City-State of Kaztani, as normal as it could be three weeks after the birth of three male heirs and no word from the Old Lion, when precisely at mid-day bells all around the City-State began to ring. Within an hour the vast city-state was aware that before sunset the Old Lion was to make an announcement.

*** Really rough outline, not that the above writing isn’t rough...lol  ***

Note: Since her birth, Amaya, the Queen Daughter has won the heart of the Old Lion and has become his treasure and greatest love.

King Qzla declares the Queen Daughter to be the Last Queen of Kaztani.

The three male heirs will each be given the Title of "Crown of Kaztani" and upon the Old Lion's death, The Queen Daughter and the Three Crowns will each inherent a section of the city to rule over.
The ruling power will be shared amongst the Old Lion’s four children. 

The Queen Daughter (aka The Last Queen) with have two votes.

Each of the Three Crowns will have one vote.

The Queen Daughter and her court will forever have free passage through out the Great City-State of Kaztani. While each of the Three Crowns may restrict/control travel through their sovereign sections of the city-state.
