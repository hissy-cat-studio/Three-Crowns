The Great Walled City-State of Kaztani, nestled at the southern tip of the Yodezil continent is home to millions of citizens is ruled by King Ozla "The Old Lion".

King Ozla, who is now in his later years, desperately desires an heir to his throne, has recently married his third Queen Wife, Anahita. King Ozla's first two Queen Wives died during labor along with unborn male heirs. It has been said, the sheer virility of the Old Lion is a curse and that no woman in all of Kaztani could bear the Old Lion's heir.

Within months of the wedding, the news of the Queen Wifeâ€™s pregnancy has spread through the vast city-state of Kaztani. As the birth ceremony grew closer, many worried for the Queen Wife. Would she survive and bear a male heir, or would she suffer the same fate as the two previous Queen Wives.

Amaya, the Queen Daughter was born. Option through the Kingdom was mixed. Many believed the Curse of the Old Lion had once again had a hand in the birth of a Queen Daughter and she signaled the loss of strength of the Old Lion, and the end of the Qzla legacy. It was simply a matter of time before the long line of Ozla rule ended and the City-State would collapse for both forces inside the walls and abroad. 

Over the next two seasons, and a procession of Mystics, Clergy, and Oracles to bless and enchant the Queen Wife to bear a male heir, news of a second pregnancy was announced. The City-State of Kazani was on edge. Would the Curse of the Old Lion strike again and bring riots and death to the streets of the Great Walled City-State?
